AWS Demos comes with several predefined deployment scripts for the demos.

We can get the list of available demos as a dict:

>>> from awsdemos.utils import available_demos

>>> available_demos = available_demos()
>>> available_demos
{'...

Each demo definition itself is a dict.

>>> all(map(lambda x: type(x) is dict, available_demos.values()))
True

All demo definition dict should have at least a 'params' list:

>>> all(map(lambda x: 'params' in x, available_demos.values()))
True

All demo definition dict should also have an plugins list:

>>> all(map(lambda x: 'plugins' in x, available_demos.values()))
True
